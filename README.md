# gssi



NOTES:
- The app is structured using the BLoC 
- I have sucessfully fetched the images or SVGs but SVG files are failed to render apparently the flutter framework still has problems rendering SVGs see: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/15501?source=post_page---------------------------
- I have successfully fetched all data provided.
- Names are searchable.
- Me and my family are going for a vacation so the development of this exam was rushed and finished it within 4 1/2 hours I started at 9am.
